## üîß Technical Implementation

### Data Generation Strategy:
All UN Data uses **synthetic data** based on real statistical patterns because:
- UN Data CSV files require manual download (not available via public API)
- Data models are based on actual UN statistical trends
- Realistic growth rates and country variations applied
- Historical events modeled (e.g., COVID-19 tourism collapse)

### Data Methods in `unDataCsvApi.ts`:
```typescript
getEducationEnrollment(countries, startYear)
getWomenInParliament(countries, startYear)
getInternationalMigrants(countries, startYear)
getHealthExpenditure(countries, startYear)
getRenewableEnergy(countries, startYear)
getTouristArrivals(countries, startYear)
```

### Chart Components Used:
- `MultiSeriesLineChart` - All trend visualizations
- `Card` components - Layout and structure
- `ChartSkeleton` - Loading states
- `ErrorMessage` - Error handling
