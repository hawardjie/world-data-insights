## Next Steps

Would you like me to implement any of these? I recommend starting with **Phase 1** additions:

1. **Housing Market Panel** - Most requested data, completely new
2. **Consumer Confidence Panel** - Simple but powerful leading indicators
3. **Government Finance Panel** - Important macro context
4. **Income & Poverty Panel** - Social/distributional dimension

Each would take 10-15 minutes to implement using your existing chart components.
